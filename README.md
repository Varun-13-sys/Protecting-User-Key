# Protecting-User-Key
This is my project on "Protecting User Password Keys at Rest (on the Disk)" using tkinter and cryptography.
we have done this project in a group of three members as an internship at "Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program 2024".
First you need to install the "VS-code" and required libraries and start on writing the code.
